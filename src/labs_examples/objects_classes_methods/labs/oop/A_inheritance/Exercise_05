Without running the code below, please tell me what will print. Why?


--> The output is "Child called" because method calls are resolved at runtime based on the actual object's type,
so the doSomething method of the Child class is invoked.



public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public Parent()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public Child()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
